# WaterWorks
Open source project designed to aid in Water Distribution and Wastewater system designs.  The project is targeted to Civil and Environmental Engineers, in order to accelerate their decision making processes by providing results of complex calculations in large scales.
The software is currently being developed using python, and it is expected to be an ongoing project so that it is, hopefully, always on par with the current trends in the industry.
